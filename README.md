## ðŸ“˜ Workflow

Workflow Understand 
- how to integrate Gemini AI models to power chatbot responsesIn our hands-on project,
- we implemented this flow using a Vanilla JavaScript frontend and a Node.js + Express backend. When the user submits a message through the chat form, the frontend sends a POST request to the /api/chat endpoint on the backend.
- The backend then uses the Gemini SDKâ€™s generateContent() method to prompt the AI model with the userâ€™s message.
-  Once Gemini returns the response, itâ€™s sent back to the frontend and displayed in the chat interface.This architecture allows us to keep the AI logic on the backendâ€”ensuring security and scalabilityâ€”while delivering a seamless conversational experience to the user.
